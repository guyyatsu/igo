# Eastern-Mysticism
This repository serves as more of a 'pet project' of mine based on a hunch I've had for a while concerning the relationsip between
the studies of the ancient esthetic mystics and modern mathematics, analytics, and computing as a whole.

Consider that the oldest surviving texts of today are clay tablets bemoaning the poor quality of copper being sold by a man named
Ea-Nasir; anthropologists will tell you that human-kind has remained relatively unchanged for as long as we've been keeping record.

Or rather; there is nothing special about the modern man and his society aside from his tools, and how long we've been sharpening those
tools.  What _is_ special, however, is exactly **what** tool we've been sharpening the longest: Our Minds.  Humans have been able to
invent computers from the minute we were able to impress an idea upon wet mud, but some "_technical overhead_" had to be settled before
we had the proper tools available to conjure the image from our minds.  The imperfections of the world around us has been like an itch
we can't scratch, driving us to improve upon the state of it little by little until every contribution snowballs into the society
we live in today.

The Sons and Daughters of Abraham would tell you that this 'itch' is the call of God; while the Gnostics would have you know that that
same god is rather your own inner sense of morality. The Pagans think it's like the Sun or something.  All I know is that if you have
an itch you can't scratch, you find a stick; you want everyone to know just how __*bad*__ Ea-Nasir's copper is, you wet some clay
and use your stick to cry about it in your blog.

Eastern Mysticism differs from Western Occultism by way of it's banality.  There is no question as to whether or not you 'believe' in
the Tao or Shinigami reaper-spirits; everyone has their own way of going about things in the same way that Death comes for all
whether it takes an anthromorphicized form or not.

To understand the link between Taoism and Computing one must understand the i-Ching and the works of Charles Boole.  Charles Boole
was famous for codifying the underlying logic behind modern computers with the publication of his (The) Mathematical Analysis of Logic
in 1847,which defines a systemof mathematics used for calculating logical truth known as Boolean Algebra.

It serves as the basis for our binary machine code and from it all logical operators used by programming languages today are
electro-mechanical implementations of his work.  To whit; Konrad Zuse's Z1 machine, developed from 1936 to 1938 and known as the first
turing-complete electro-mechanical machine operating under a binary ruleset, was invented almost 100 years after The Mathematical
Analysis of Logic was published.

In much the same way that the i-Ching was written nearly _thousands_ of years before Boole was even alive but lays the foundational
argument for binary logic in the first place, while also appealing to that 'human itch' that drives all innovation and spirituality.


## The Book of Changes.
The i-Ching is the Chinese Book of Changes; which describes a method of divinitory cleromancy as the practically-applied teachings of
the Eastern mystics.  The book consists of a table of the eight potential three-digit combinations of Yin and Yang known as Trigrams,
and the sixty-four Double-Trigrams called Hexagrams.

Each of the Eight Trigrams represents one of the classical elements of Eastern Mysticism:  
  - Qian(Heaven)
  - Dui(Lake)
  - Li(Fire)
  - Zhen(Thunder)
  - Xun(Wind)
  - Kan(Water)
  - Gen(Mountain)
  - Kun(Earth)


## Igo
Igo, or Go to the West, is the oldest living game still being played in it's original form.  When it first came
to the West it was used as a tool for teaching morality to students of philosophy, but it has always been used
for that as well in the East along with teaching battle tactics to students of kenjutsu.

Interestingly, the game has a near-infinite complexity with the number of possible states reaching to around 100^200;
the depths of it's permutations have consistently resisted brute-force lookup table searching algorithms such as those used
by chess-playing algorithms for decades. So far even the best go-playing algorithms can only perform at the level
of a moderately skilled human player at best.
